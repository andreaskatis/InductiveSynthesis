\begin{abstract}
In recent work, we proposed an extension of our realizability checking algorithm
for assume-guarantee contracts using theories. Given the k-inductive proof of a
contract's realizability, we use the power of a sophisticated skolemizer for
$\forall\exists$ formulas to construct an implementation composed of \textit{k}
skolem functions, guaranteed to comply to the user-defined requirements.
The algorithm is similar to k-induction model checking, but involves the use of 
quantifiers to determine realizability.

For the purposes of this paper we developed the proposed synthesis algorithm,
and successfully applied it to synthesize implementations for simple case
studies. We informally prove the algorithm's correctness and report our results
as well as the lessons that we learned during this experiment. Finally, we
discuss possible future directions that need to be explored to further improve the algorithm's application domain, optimality and efficiency.

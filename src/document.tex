\begin{abstract}
\grigory{I think, in the abstract, we need to be more enthusiastic about the contributions.
Currently, it reads like there is a little of novelty: we extend the prior work, the approach is similar to something else, the evaluation is simple and so on.
I believe, the abstract should sell the technique, and be precise about the positive evaluation points.
Also, I would avoid messages like ``In recent work'' and ``our realizability checking algorithm''
since the reviewers most likely are unaware of them.
Instead, I would describe a bit what is ``k- inductive proof'' and possibly mention that this proof 
is not necessarily to be given by your algorithm. This way, the synthesis algorithm 
will look more generic, and the paper's contributions will be stronger.
Finally, the abstract should not contain the summary of the paper (i.e., the last two sentences).}

Program synthesis is a particularly interesting area of current research in
artificial intelligence, and more recently in formal verification. The main idea
is generate efficient implementations for systems, using the system-specific
requirements as the only source of information. This is especially important for
the case of embedded systems that are meant to be used as leaf-level,
independent components of a bigger, more complex hierarchical architecture.

One of the very challenging problems in requirements engineering is for one to
decide whether the documented requirements are good enough to pivot the
development of an implementation that is guaranteed to meet them, given any circumstance.
This is mostly known as the implementability, or realizability problem.
Misconceptions and conflicts between requirements may occur during this process, and might not be
easy to detect without the use of sophisticated tools, meaning that the engineer
can end up with specification for which an implementation does not even exist.
This fact alone can impose a big overhead in the system's development cycle, both in time and in cost of development.
Having a proof of realizability  for our requirements though, among other
interesting requirement characteristics, directly implies that we can
construct an implementation for them. Furthermore, if used properly, the same
proof can be actually used to construct such an implementation automatically,
and thus solve the problem of program synthesis.

In the context of this paper, we propose a program synthesis algorithm for
requirements written in the form of an Assume-Guarantee contract, using the
Lustre specification language. The algorithm relies heavily on the proof of
the contract's realizability, using an approach that is very similar to k-induction model checking, with the additional use of quantifiers.
With the k-inductive proof as a guide, and a sophisticated tool for
extracting Skolem functions from $\forall\exists$-formulas, we can effectively synthesize
implementations that, by definition, are guaranteed to comply with the contract.
We have incorporated the main synthesis algorithm as an extension to the
realizability check provided in the JKind model checker, and furthermore
developed a compiler to translate these primitive implementations to the C
language. The resulting implementations in C are further being tested and
compared against the corresponding implementations provided by LustreC, a
compiler from Lustre to C implementations.

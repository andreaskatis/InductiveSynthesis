\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:impl}

We develop \jkindsynt, our synthesis algorithm on top of \jkind~\cite{jkind},
a Java-implementation of the \textsc{KIND} model
checker~\cite{Hagen08:kind}. Each model is described using the Lustre
Specification language, which is used as an intermediate language to formally verify contracts in the
Assume-Guarantee Reasoning (\textsc{AGREE}) framework~\cite{NFM2012:CoGaMiWhLaLu}.
Internally, \jkind is using two parallel engines in order to construct a
k-inductive proof for the property of interest. The first order formulas that
are being constructed are then fed to the \textsc{Z3} SMT
solver~\cite{DeMoura08:z3} which provides state of the art support for reasoning
over quantifiers and incremental search.
\grigory{What are the two parallel engines?}

\grigory{Again, this is confusing why do you use Z3 and then \aeval? \aeval proves valid / invalid anyway. So the same job is performed twice. And \aeval internally calls Z3. If you want to emphasize LRA/LIA business, I would just do it in the footnote.}

Provided with the assumption that the check queries are satisfiable according to
the results received by the SMT solver, we proceed to construct a collection of
Skolem functions using the \aeval Skolemizer%
\footnote{More info about \aeval can be found at~\url{http://www.inf.usi.ch/phd/fedyukovich/niagara}.}.
\aeval  uses LRA as a background logic, and thus casts all numeric variables to Reals and provides the Skolem relation over Reals as well.%
\footnote{To increase precision, of the realizability checks over LIA, \jkind has an option to use \textsc{Z3} directly.}
In future work, we plan to enhance  \aeval for Linear Integer Arithmetic (LIA) to soundly support Skolem relation over Integers.

The final step of our implementation involved the creation of a specific purpose
translation tool, which is currently called \textsc{SMTLib2C}%
\footnote{The source code
is available at \url{https://github.com/andrewkatis/SMTLib2C}}. The translation tool
is still at a very primitive state in terms of optimizations, a goal that we
eventually want to address as part of our future work.
\grigory{Never say that something is in ``very primitive state''. Don't under-emphasize your contributions.}

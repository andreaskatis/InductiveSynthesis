\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:impl}

We develop \jkindsynt, our synthesis algorithm on top of \jkind~\cite{jkind},
a Java-implementation of the \textsc{KIND} model
checker~\cite{Hagen08:kind}. Each model is described using the Lustre
Specification language, which is used as an intermediate language to formally verify contracts in the
Assume-Guarantee Reasoning (\textsc{AGREE}) framework~\cite{NFM2012:CoGaMiWhLaLu}.
Internally, \jkind uses two parallel engines (for $\mathit{BaseCheck}$ and
$\mathit{ExtendCheck}$) in order to construct a k-inductive proof for the
property of interest.
The first order formulas that are being constructed are then fed to the \textsc{Z3} SMT
solver~\cite{DeMoura08:z3} which provides state of the art support for reasoning
over quantifiers and incremental search.

For all valid $\forall\exists$-formulas, \jkindsynt proceeds to construct a list of
Skolem functions using the \aeval Skolemizer.
\aeval uses LRA as a background logic, and thus casts all numeric variables to reals and provides the Skolem relation over reals as well.%
\footnote{For realizability checks over Linear Integer and Real
  Arithmetic (LIRA), \jkind has an option to use \textsc{Z3} directly.}
In future work, we plan to enhance \aeval for Linear Integer Arithmetic (LIA) to soundly support Skolem relation over integers.

The final step of our implementation involved the creation of a specific purpose
translation tool, which we currently call \textsc{SMTLib2C}%
\footnote{The source code
is available at \url{https://github.com/andrewkatis/SMTLib2C}}. The list
of the Skolem functions is given as an input to the compiler, which in turn uses
them to generate implementations in the C language. 
Note that during this translation process, real
variables in Skolem functions are being defined as floats in C. This might cause some
overflow errors in the final implementation. 
Improving on this is our primary goal in future work.
%In future work,
%we intend to further improve on this, and
%many other aspects of the compiler's performance as part of an individual
%future work.

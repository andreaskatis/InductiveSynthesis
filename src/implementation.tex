\grigory{moved the paragraph from section 2 here. More info about the implementation would be desirable. Some details about smtlib2 -> C conversion, maybe}

The structure of the Skolem relation is simple enough to translate
into a program in a mainstream language.
We need implementations that are able to keep track of the
current state variables, the current inputs, as well as some history
about the variable values in previous states. This can easily be handled, for
example, in C with the use of arrays to keep record of each variable's $k$ last
values, and the use of functions that update each variable's corresponding array
to reflect the changes following a new step using the transition relation.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We presented a novel synthesis algorithm for
to automatically synthesize implementations, using requirements expressed in the
form of an Assume-Guarantee contract. Our approach supports the theory of
rational arithmetic and combines the advantages of a model checking approach
that is very similar to k-induction, with the strength of a sophisticated solver
that can effectively decide on the validity of formulas on realizability, as
well as extract witnesses capable of being directly used as the core fragments
of a synthesized implementation. Finally, we excercised our final tool against
models of different contract complexity, with results that gave us fruitful
conclusions on the algorithm's overall performance.

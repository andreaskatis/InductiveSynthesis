\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In  this paper, we contributed the approach to program synthesis guided by the proofs of realizability of Assume-Guarantee contracts.
Our approach is based on the notion of realizability, the proving of which requires k-induction-based reasoning to decide validity of a set of $\forall\exists$-formulas.
Whenever a contract is proven realizable, our approach employs the Skolemization procedure and extracts a fine-grained witness to the realizability.
The Skolem functions are finally encoded into a desirable implementation.
We implemented the technique in the \toolname{} tool and evaluated for the set of Lustre models of different complexity.
The experimental results provided fruitful conclusions on the overall efficacy of the the approach.
